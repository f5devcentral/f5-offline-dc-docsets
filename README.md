## Usage

These docsets are compatible with docset readers such as:

for Mac, [Kapeli Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)
for Windows, [Velocity](https://velocity.silverlakesoftware.com/)
for Linux, [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/)

## Installation

Once you have your docset reader of choice installed, simply unpack the docsets and follow your reader's documentation for loading local files. I recommend adding both the Tcl 8.4 docset for v11 work and Tcl 8.5 for v12+ work as they can be very useful to have to hand.

### Dash

Click on each link in the list of available docsets to add the docset feed to your Dash. Go to the Downloads tab and download each docset you're interested in.

*Tip:* you can customise the shortcuts for Dash docsets by opening Dash, going into preferences (`cmd-comma`) then in the docset tab double-clicking the shortcut column or selecting a docset and pressing `Edit Keyword` button.

### Velocity

Download all the `.docset.tgz` files from `docsets` to your PC.

Navigate to Add/Download Docsets, select XCode, then press Import. Open each `.docset.tgz` you're interested in to add to Velocity.

## Background

These docsets are created for convenience and offline use. They are fast, searchable resources covering the DevCentral API documentation for various F5 technologies.

The docsets I personally use are the ones that see the most love, iRules, iApps and iControlREST.

I only periodically update the docsets, typically when major changes appear in DevCentral. While feedback is very welcome, and changes may be included in future versions, this is not my day-job, and is not at all managed by the DevCentral team. 

**Your milage may vary, particularly in city use versus highway.**

These docsets are only tested by me on my Mac using Dash, though they get a lot of use there.
